#### Architecture

- **Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs):** The building blocks of FPGAs, consisting of logic gates and flip-flops.
- **Interconnects:** Programmable connections that allow the CLBs to be wired together to form complex circuits.
- **Input/Output Blocks (IOBs):** Interface the FPGA with external components.
- **Embedded Blocks:** Specialized blocks such as multipliers, DSPs, and memory modules.

#### Design Process

1. **Specification:** Define the functional requirements and constraints of the FPGA-based system.
2. **Design Entry:** Create a design using HDLs or high-level synthesis tools.
3. **Synthesis:** Convert the HDL design into a netlist.
4. **Place and Route:** Determine the placement of logic blocks and routing of interconnects.
5. **Configuration:** Load the design onto the FPGA using a configuration file (bitstream).
6. **Testing:** Verify the functionality of the programmed FPGA.

#### Applications

- **Prototyping:** FPGAs are commonly used for developing and testing new designs before committing to an ASIC.
- **Aerospace and Defense:** Their reconfigurability makes FPGAs ideal for adaptive systems and secure applications.
- **Data Centers:** FPGAs are used for accelerating data processing tasks such as machine learning and encryption.
