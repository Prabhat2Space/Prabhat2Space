**Fundamentals of RS-232 Serial Communications**

Due to its relative simplicity and low hardware overhead (when compared to parallel interfacing), serial communications is used extensively within the electronics industry. 
Today, the most popular serial communications standard is certainly the EIA/TIA-232-E specification. 
This standard, which was developed by the Electronic Industry Association and the Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA), is more popularly called simply RS-232, 
where RS stands for "recommended standard." Although this RS prefix has been replaced in recent years with EIA/TIA to help identify the source of the standard, this paper uses the common RS-232 notation.

### Introduction

The official name of the EIA/TIA-232-E standard is "Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Termination Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange." 
Although the name may sound intimidating, the standard is simply concerned with serial data communication between a host system (Data Terminal Equipment, or DTE) and a peripheral system (Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment, or DCE).

The EIA/TIA-232-E standard was introduced in 1962 and has since been updated four times to meet the evolving needs of serial communication applications. 
The letter "E" in the standard's name indicates that this is the fifth revision of the standard.

### RS-232 Specifications

RS-232 is a complete standard. This means that the standard sets out to ensure compatibility between the host and peripheral systems by specifying:

- Common voltage and signal levels
- Common pin-wiring configurations
- A minimal amount of control information between the host and peripheral systems.

Unlike many standards which simply specify the electrical characteristics of a given interface, RS-232 specifies electrical, functional, and mechanical characteristics to meet the above three criteria. 
Each of these aspects of the RS-232 standard is below.

#### Electrical Characteristics

The electrical characteristics section of the RS-232 standard specifies voltage levels, rate of change for signal levels, and line impedance.

As the original RS-232 standard was defined in 1962 and before the days of TTL logic, it is no surprise that the standard does not use 5V and ground logic levels. 
Instead, a high level for the driver output is defined as between +5V to +15V, and a low level for the driver output is defined as between -5V and -15V. 
The receiver logic levels were defined to provide a 2V noise margin. As such, a high level for the receiver is defined as between +3V to +15V, and a low level is between -3V to -15V. 

It is necessary to note that, for RS-232 communication, a low level (-3V to -15V) is defined as a logic 1 and is historically referred to as "marking." 
Similarly, a high level (+3V to +15V) is defined as a logic 0 and is referred to as "spacing."



The RS-232 standard also limits the maximum slew rate at the driver output. This limitation was included to help reduce the likelihood of crosstalk between adjacent signals. 
The slower the rise and fall time, the less chance of crosstalk. With this in mind, the maximum slew rate allowed is 30V/ms. Additionally, standard defines a maximum data rate of 20kbps, again to reduce the chance of crosstalk.

The impedance of the interface between the driver and receiver has also been defined. The load seen by the driver is specified at 3kΩ to 7kΩ. 
In the original RS-232 standard, the cable length between the driver and receiver was specified to be 15 meters maximum. Revision "D" (EIA/TIA-232-D) changed this part of the standard. 
Instead of specifying the maximum length of cable, the standard specified a maximum capacitive load of 2500pF, clearly a more adequate specification. 
The maximum cable length is determined by the capacitance per unit length of the cable, which is provided in the cable specifications.

Table 1 summarizes the electrical specifications in the current standard.

#### Functional Characteristics

Because RS-232 is a complete standard, it includes more than just specifications on electrical characteristics. 
The standard also addresses the functional characteristics of the interface. This essentially means that RS-232 defines the function of the different signals used in the interface. 
These signals are divided into four different categories: common, data, control, and timing. 
See Table 2. The standard provides abundant control signals and supports a primary and secondary communications channel. 
Fortunately, few applications, if any, require all these defined signals. For example, only eight signals are used for a typical modem. 
Examples of how the RS-232 standard is used in real-world applications are discussed later. The complete list of defined signals is included here as a reference. 
Reviewing the functionality of all these signals is, however, beyond the scope of this paper.

### Mechanical Interface Characteristics

The third area covered by RS-232 is the mechanical interface. Specifically, RS-232 specifies a 25-pin connector as the minimum connector size that can accommodate all the signals defined in the functional portion of the standard. 
The pin assignment for this connector is shown in Figure 2. The connector for DCE equipment is male for the connector housing and female for the connection pins. Likewise, the DTE connector is a female housing with male connection pins. Although RS-232 specifies a 25-position connector, this connector is often not used. Most applications do not require all the defined signals, so a 25-pin connector is larger than necessary. Consequently, other connector types are commonly used. Perhaps the most popular connector is the 9-position DB9S connector, also illustrated in Figure 2. This 9-position connector provides, for example, the means to transmit and receive the necessary signals for modem applications. This type of application will be discussed in greater detail later.

### Evolution of RS-232 IC Design

#### Regulated Charge Pumps

The original MAX232 Driver/Receiver and its related parts simply doubled and inverted the input voltage to supply the RS-232 driver circuitry. This design enabled much more voltage than actually required; it wasted power. 
The EIA-232 levels are defined as ±5V into 5kΩ loads. While the RS-232 specification allows a maximum driver voltage of ±15V, a ±7.5V driver meets the specifications. This is why most recent RS-232 driver/receiver ICs incorporate regulated charge pumps that provide approximately ±7.5V.

#### Low-Power RS-232 Drivers

Lower-power ICs usually use a combination of design techniques to accomplish low power consumption. Regulated charge pumps help reduce the amount of power wasted by the driver. 
In addition, the driver IC is usually configured as a CMOS device with several stages of complementary MOS (CMOS) circuitry to ensure low power consumption.

### Common RS-232 ICs

Several generations of ICs have been developed to provide RS-232 driver/receiver functions. Table 3 shows a few examples from Maxim.

| MAX3241E | 1µA | 3 | 5 | 28 | TTL/CMOS | RS-232 | High Speed |

### Example Applications

One common application of RS-232 is to interface a computer with a modem.

### Conclusion

RS-232 is a widely used serial communications standard that provides electrical, functional, and mechanical specifications for interfacing between DTE and DCE. 
Despite its age, RS-232 continues to be utilized due to its simplicity and reliability. Understanding the fundamentals of RS-232 helps in designing and troubleshooting communication systems that still rely on this classic standard.
