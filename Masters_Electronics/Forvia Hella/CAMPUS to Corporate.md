# My Campus to Corporate Training Experience

##  Introduction

Transitioning from the academic environment of a college campus to the professional setting of a corporate office can be a challenging experience for many graduates. 
During my internship at Fourvia Hella Automation, one of the top automotive OEMs, I attended a comprehensive campus to corporate training program designed to bridge this gap. 
This program equipped me with the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary to succeed in the corporate world.

mindset development for software developer roles, legal information (such as POSH and similar policies), corporate dressing styles, and expected behaviors throughout my employment journey.

   - The program encouraged a mindset of continuous learning. I learned to be open to feedback and willing to acquire new skills and knowledge as I progressed in my career.
