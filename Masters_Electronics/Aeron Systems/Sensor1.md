# Working Principles of Sensors

# 1. **Air Humidity and Temperature Sensor**

**Working Principle:**

The air humidity and temperature sensor (such as the MeteoTemp) typically uses a combination of thermistors for temperature sensing and capacitive or resistive elements for humidity sensing.

- **Temperature Sensing:**
  - A thermistor changes its resistance with temperature. This change is measured and converted to a temperature reading using a temperature coefficient.
  - The relationship between resistance (R) and temperature (T) is given by the Steinhart-Hart equation:  
    \[ \frac{1}{T} = A + B \ln(R) + C \ln^3(R) \]
  - Here, \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are constants determined by calibration.

- **Humidity Sensing:**
  - A capacitive humidity sensor has a dielectric material between two conductive plates. The dielectric constant changes with humidity, altering the capacitance.
  - The capacitance (C) is related to the relative humidity (RH) as:  
    \[ C = C_0 \left( 1 + k_1 \text{RH} + k_2 \text{RH}^2 \right) \]
  - Here, \( C_0 \) is the baseline capacitance, and \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) are constants.

**Scientific Calculations:**

- **Temperature (T):**
  \[ T = \frac{1}{A + B \ln(R) + C \ln^3(R)} \]
- **Relative Humidity (RH):**
  \[ \text{RH} = \frac{C - C_0}{k_1 C_0} \]

#### 2. **Rain Gauge Sensor**

**Working Principle:**

The self-emptying bucket rain gauge (tipping bucket rain gauge) measures rainfall by collecting water in a small bucket until it tips. Each tip represents a fixed volume of water.

- **Rainfall Measurement:**
  - The volume of each tip is calibrated, and the number of tips over time is counted.
  - Rainfall (R) is calculated as:  
    \[ R = \frac{N \times V}{A} \]
  - Here, \( N \) is the number of tips, \( V \) is the volume of each tip, and \( A \) is the area of the orifice.

**Block Diagram:**

1. Funnel (collects rainwater)
2. Tipping Bucket Mechanism
3. Reed Switch or Optical Sensor (detects tips)
4. Microcontroller (counts tips and calculates rainfall)
5. Output Interface (MODBUS RS485)

**Scientific Calculations:**

- **Rainfall (R):**
  \[ R = \frac{N \times V}{A} \]

#### 3. **Wind Speed and Direction Sensor**

**Working Principle:**

The wind speed and direction sensor (such as the MeteoWind) often uses an anemometer and a wind vane.

- **Wind Speed:**
  - A cup anemometer or propeller anemometer measures wind speed by the rotational speed of its cups or blades.
  - The rotational speed (RPM) is proportional to wind speed (V).
  - Wind speed (V) can be calculated as:  
    \[ V = k \times \text{RPM} \]
  - Here, \( k \) is a calibration constant.

- **Wind Direction:**
  - A wind vane aligns itself with the wind direction, and its position is measured by a potentiometer or optical encoder.
  - The direction (D) is obtained from the angular position of the vane.

**Block Diagram:**

4. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
5. Microcontroller (for data processing and MODBUS communication)
6. Output Interface (MODBUS RS485)

 [Wind Vane] ----> [Signal Conditioning] ----> [ADC] ----> [Microcontroller] ----> [MODBUS RS485]
```


**Scientific Calculations:**

- **Wind Speed (V):**
  \[ V = k \times \text{RPM} \]
- **Wind Direction (D):**
  \[ D = \theta \]
  - Here, \( \theta \) is the angular position from the potentiometer or encoder.
