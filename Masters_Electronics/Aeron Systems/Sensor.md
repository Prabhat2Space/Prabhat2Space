### Working Principles

The BARANIDESIGN Wind Speed & Wind Direction MODBUS sensor operates based on well-established principles of anemometry and wind vane technology.

#### Wind Speed Measurement

Wind speed is typically measured using a cup or propeller anemometer. In a cup anemometer, three or four cups are mounted symmetrically on horizontal arms attached to a vertical shaft.
As the wind blows, it causes the cups to rotate around the shaft. The rotational speed is proportional to the wind speed.
The sensor converts the rotational speed into an electrical signal, which is then processed to provide a digital output in meters per second.

In a propeller anemometer, the wind rotates a horizontal propeller, and the rotational speed of the propeller is measured to determine the wind speed.

#### Wind Direction Measurement

Wind direction is measured using a wind vane. The vane consists of a fin mounted on a vertical axis. The fin aligns itself with the wind direction, and the orientation of the vane is measured using a potentiometer or an encoder. 
The sensor then converts this orientation into a digital output representing the wind direction in degrees.

### MODBUS Communication Protocol

The MODBUS RTU protocol is a serial communication protocol widely used in industrial automation and control systems. 
It allows multiple devices to be connected to a single communication bus, enabling easy integration and data exchange.

#### Key Characteristics of MODBUS RTU:

1. **Master-Slave Architecture**: MODBUS RTU follows a master-slave architecture where the master device initiates communication, and the slave devices respond. The wind sensor acts as a slave device.

2. **Data Frames**: MODBUS RTU data is transmitted in frames, which include a device address, function code, data, and error-checking fields. This structure ensures reliable data transmission and error detection.

3. **Baud Rate**: The communication speed, or baud rate, can be configured, typically ranging from 9600 to 115200 bps (bits per second).

4. **Function Codes**: MODBUS RTU defines various function codes for different types of data transactions, such as reading input registers, writing to output registers, and diagnostic functions.

5. **Data Integrity**: Error checking is performed using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), ensuring the integrity of the transmitted data.
