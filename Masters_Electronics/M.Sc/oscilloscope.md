### Functions of Each Component

1. **Input Signal:**
   - **Function:** The input signal is the electrical signal that you want to observe or measure. This signal is applied to the vertical amplifier for processing.

2. **Vertical Amplifier:**
   - **Function:** The vertical amplifier amplifies the input signal to a suitable level for display. It controls the vertical deflection of the electron beam on the screen.
     This amplification is crucial for ensuring that even small signals can be observed clearly on the display.

3. **Trigger System:**
   - **Function:** The trigger system stabilizes the waveform display by ensuring that the sweep starts at the same point on each cycle of the waveform. This allows for a steady, repeatable display of the waveform. Various triggering options are available, such as edge, pulse, and video triggers, to capture different signal characteristics.

4. **Time Base Control:**
   - **Function:** The time base control determines the speed at which the horizontal sweep moves across the screen.
      It controls the horizontal deflection and allows you to zoom in or out on the waveform to see more or less detail. The time base is calibrated in seconds per division.

5. **Delay Line:**
   - **Function:** The delay line is used to delay the signal slightly before it reaches the vertical deflection system. This delay ensures that the oscilloscope has enough time to trigger and start the sweep at the correct time, allowing the leading edge of the waveform to be displayed.

6. **Vertical Deflection Plates:**
   - **Function:** The vertical deflection plates control the movement of the electron beam up and down (vertically) on the screen based on the input signal.
     The amount of deflection is proportional to the voltage of the input signal after it has been amplified.

7. **Horizontal Deflection Plates:**
   - **Function:** The horizontal deflection plates control the movement of the electron beam left and right (horizontally) on the screen, synchronized with the time base control. This movement creates the time axis on the display.

8. **CRT/Display:**
   - **Function:** In older analog oscilloscopes, a cathode ray tube (CRT) was used to display the waveform. Modern digital oscilloscopes use an LCD or LED screen.
     The display shows the waveform, with the vertical axis representing voltage and the horizontal axis representing time.
     The screen also often displays measurement grids, called graticules, to help users quantify signal characteristics.

### Additional Notes:

- **Probes (not shown in the diagram):** Probes are used to connect the oscilloscope to the circuit under test. They often have attenuation options (e.g., 10x, 100x) to prevent high-voltage signals from damaging the oscilloscope and to reduce the loading effect on the circuit.
- **Attenuators (part of the Vertical Amplifier):** Attenuators are used to scale down high input signals to a manageable level before they reach the vertical amplifier, preventing overload.
- **ADC (in Digital Oscilloscopes):** The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in digital oscilloscopes samples the input signal and converts it to a digital format for processing and display.

This block diagram and explanation provide a detailed understanding of how an oscilloscope works and the role of each component in signal processing and display.
